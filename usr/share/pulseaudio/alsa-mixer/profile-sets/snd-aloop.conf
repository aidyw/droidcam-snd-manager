# ALSA snd-allop profile.
# Reminder of ALSA structure, hw:card:pcm[0:1]:sub-stream[0:7]
# pcm channels are tied to each other via the loopback.
# Eg. If you TX a stream (PLAYBACK into the kernel) using pcm1p, it will be RX (CAPTURE from the kernel) on pcm0c
# Likewise TX on pcm0p will RX on pcm1c
# Each pcm channel can operate in both directions simultaneoulsy. 
# They always cross-over pcm0p >> pcm1c,  pcm1p >> pcm0c 
# This same logic applies for all 8 substreams.
